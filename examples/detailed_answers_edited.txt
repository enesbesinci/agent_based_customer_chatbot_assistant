## Agent-Based Customer Chatbot Workflow

Each entry in this file follows the same structure, which is detailed below:

1. **Customer Question:**  
   This is the initial query submitted by the customer.

2. **Initial AI Message:**  
   The model receives the question and decides how to process it. At this stage, it **initiates a tool call**.  
   - **Tool Call Details:**  
     - **Tool Name & Call ID:** Indicates which tool is invoked and the unique identifier for the call.  
     - **Arguments:** The parameters sent to the tool (e.g., search query or product name).

3. **Tool Response:**  
   The output returned by the called tool (such as product details, search results, or FAQ answers).

4. **Final Model Response:**  
   The AI synthesizes the tool's response and delivers a clear, final answer to the customer.
